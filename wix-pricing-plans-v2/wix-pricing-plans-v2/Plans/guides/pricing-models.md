# Pricing models
Pricing models contain the [pricing and duration options](https://support.wix.com/en/article/pricing-plans-creating-a-plan#step-3-setting-the-price-and-duration-of-your-plan) for a plan.

Plans are based on a pricing model, which is defined with the plan's `pricing` property. A pricing model can be one of the following:
+ **A subscription:** A plan with recurring payment cycles.
    
*Example:* A 1-year subscription with monthly, recurring payments. Each payment is $25, so the total price for the plan is $300. In this example, the subscription is in its third month.
 
`cycleDuration` is the length of one payment cycle. Multiply `cycleDuration`'s `count` by `cycleCount` to get the subscription duration. Currently, `cycleDuration` only supports a value of `1`.

`index` of `currentCycle` is the current payment cycle for the subscription. `index` is `0` when the order is in a free trial period. In all other cases, the `index` starts with `1` for the first payment cycle in the subscription. For orders with a single payment, the `index` will remain `1` throughout the duration.
```javascript
    "pricing": {
        "subscription": {
            "cycleDuration": {
                // Payment recurs every month
                "count": 1,
                "unit": "MONTH"
            },
            // for 12 times
            "cycleCount": 12
        },               
        "prices": [{              
            "duration": {
                "cycleFrom": 1,
                "numberOfCycles": 12
            },
            "price": {
                "subtotal": "25",
                "discount": "0",
                "total": "25",
                "currency": "USD"
            }
        }]
    }, 
    ...
    "currentCycle": {
        "index": 3,
        "startedDate": "2022-03-01T13:45:53.129Z",
        "endedDate": "2022-04-01T13:45:53.129Z"
    },
```
+ **A Single Payment for Duration plan:** A plan paid for with a single payment. The plan does not renew after the duration.
 
*Example:* A plan with a single payment of $35 for 3 months. 

The `duration` `cycleFrom` and `numberOfCycles` will both be `1`, as the single price applies to the entirety of the subscription.

`index` of `currentCycle` will remain `1` throughout the duration.
```javascript
    "pricing": {
        "singlePaymentForDuration": {
            // Plan duration is 3 months
            "count": 3,
            "unit": "MONTH"
        },
        "prices": [{              
            "duration": {
                "cycleFrom": 1,
                "numberOfCycles": 1
            },
            "price": {
                "subtotal": "35",
                "discount": "0",
                "total": "35",
                "currency": "USD"
            }
        }]
    },
    ...
    "currentCycle": {
        "index": 1,
        "startedDate": "2022-01-01T13:45:53.129Z",
        "endedDate": "2022-04-01T13:45:53.129Z"
    },        
```
+ **A Single Payment Unlimited plan:** A plan paid for with a single payment. The plan does not expire and remains valid until canceled.

*Example:* An unlimited plan that is paid for in advance with one payment of $200. 

`singlePaymentUnlimited` is `true`.

The `duration` `cycleFrom` and `numberOfCycles` will remain `1` throughout the duration of the plan.

`index` of `currentCycle` will remain `1` throughout the duration. `singlePaymentUnlimitedPlans` don't return an `endedDate` in `currentCycle`.
```javascript
    "pricing": {
        "singlePaymentUnlimited": true,
        "prices": [{
            "duration": {
                "cycleFrom": 1,
                "numberOfCycles": 1
            },                
            "price": {
                "subtotal": "200",
                "discount": "0",
                "total": "200",
                "currency": "USD"
            }
        }]
    },
    ...
    "currentCycle": {
        "index": 1,
        "startedDate": "2021-06-015T13:45:53.129Z"
    },        
```

### Free plans and free trial periods
A free plan that is valid until canceled is a `singlePaymentUnlimited` pricing model. A free plan with a limited duration is treated as a `singlePaymentForDuration` pricing model.

A site owner can also add a free trial period, in days, to a `subscription` pricing model. When the free trial is over, the first payment cycle begins and the buyer is billed. During the free trial period, the `index` of `currentCycle` is `0`. A buyer only receives the free trial period for the first time they purchase a plan. For example, a buyer purchases a monthly plan for 3 months that includes a 7-day free trial period. The buyer may purchase the same plan again, for another 3 months, but will not receive the 7-day free trial period.

When a buyer cancels their order during the free trial period, their subscription will expire at the end of the free trial period and they will not be billed. A site owner can [cancel an ordered plan](wix-pricing-plans-v2/orders/cancelorder) during the free trial period and choose to apply the cancellation `IMMEDIATELY` or at the `NEXT_PAYMENT_DATE`. 

Canceling `IMMEDIATELY` ends the subscription for the buyer immediately, even during the free trial period, and the buyer won't be billed. Canceling at the `NEXT_PAYMENT_DATE` allows the buyer to continue using the benefits of the subscription until the end of the free trial period. Then, the subscription ends and the buyer is not billed.

### Pricing plan types and visibility

+ **Public pricing plans** are visible plans that site members and visitors can see on the site and purchase. By default, pricing plans are public when created.
 
+ **Hidden pricing plans** are plans whose `public` property has been set to `false`. These plans cannot be seen on the site by the site member or visitor. For example, consider hiding a plan if it has reached its maximum capacity and temporarily is not available for purchase. 
 
    Changing a planâ€™s visibility with the `public` property does not impact existing purchases. All purchases for hidden plans are still active and keep their terms and payment options.
 
+ **Active pricing plans** include all non-archived plans, such as public plans and hidden plans.
 
+ **Archived pricing plans** are plans that are no longer needed on the site. For example, discontinued plans. When a plan is archived, it is no longer visible as a public plan that can be chosen by site visitors. 

The `public` property is automatically set to `false` when a plan is archived. Archived plans cannot be purchased. 

Site owners can see archived plans in the Dashboard under **Pricing Plans -> Archived Plans**. 

Archiving cannot be reversed. Once archived, a plan cannot be set as active again for purchase. Archiving does not impact existing purchases made for the plan. All purchases are still active and keep their pricing and terms.
