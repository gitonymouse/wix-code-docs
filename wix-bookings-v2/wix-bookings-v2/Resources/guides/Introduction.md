The Bookings Resources API provides functionality for creating, managing, and querying resources.

A resource is a business asset like a staff member, or equipment needed to provide a service.
Each resource owns a schedule. The schedule defines the resource's availability. You can set up a custom schedule for a resource, use the business's default working hours, or combine the two.

Resources have tags that you can use for grouping. For example, add a `"room"` tag for classroom resources and an `"equipment"` tag for resources like computers and projectors.

There are 2 tags that are used by the Wix Bookings app:
- `"staff"`: Resources with the `"staff"` tag appear in the Bookings app's **Staff** page. 
- `"business"`: The Bookings app creates a resource with a name and tag value of `"business"`. This resource owns a schedule that contains the operating hours of the business and cannot be deleted. This schedule is used when creating resources that use the businessâ€™s operating hours for the resource's working hours.

You can have up to 135 active resources and an additional 135 deleted resources.

To use the Resources API, import `resources` from the `wix-bookings.v2` module:

```javascript
import { resources } from "wix-bookings.v2";
```
